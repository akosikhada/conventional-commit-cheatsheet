# Conventional Commit Cheatsheet

A comprehensive guide to standardize your commit messages using the Conventional Commits specification. This repository provides developers with a structured reference for implementing the Conventional Commits standard in their Git workflow, including commit types, formatting rules, and best practices.

## üìö Overview

Conventional Commits provide a lightweight convention on top of commit messages, offering a simple set of rules for creating an explicit commit history. This standardized format makes your project history clear, consistent, and machine-readable, enabling:

- Automatic versioning and release notes
- Clear communication of changes to teammates
- Easier maintenance and collaboration on projects
- Better organization of git history

This cheatsheet serves as a quick reference guide for developers looking to implement Conventional Commits in their workflow.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Commit Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Quick Start

1. **Make changes** to your codebase
2. **Stage your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add <files>   # Specific files
   git add .         # All changes
   ```
3. **Create a conventional commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(auth): add login with Google feature"
   ```
4. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

## ‚ú® Features

Conventional Commits provide several key benefits:

- **Automatic Versioning**: Enables semantic versioning based on commit types
- **Improved Readability**: Makes commit history clear and understandable
- **Automated Tools**: Enables automating changelogs and release notes
- **Better Collaboration**: Helps teams understand changes at a glance
- **Structured History**: Creates a well-organized project history
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Facilitates automated testing and deployment
- **Simplified Code Reviews**: Makes code reviews more efficient

### Secondary Types

| Type     | Description                                        | Example                                     |

| `env`    | Environment setup or configuration changes         | `env(docker): update staging configuration` |

### Adding Scope (Optional)

The scope provides context about what part of the codebase is affected:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(authentication): add password reset flow"
```

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change response format of user endpoints"
```

Or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(api): change response format of user endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The response format has been modified to follow JSON:API specification"
```
